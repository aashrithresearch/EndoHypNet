# EndoHypNet: Histopathology-Aware Classifier for Early Endometrial Hyperplasia Diagnosis using Deep Learning
This repository provides a full pipeline for training deep learning models (InceptionV3, ResNet50, MobileNetV5) on histopathological images to classify endometrial tissue as **Normal Endometrium** or **Endometrial Hyperplasia**
Built using `Fastai`, `Timm`, and `albumentations`, the pipeline also supports explainability using SHAP and Integrated Gradients

## Dataset
This project uses the dataset from:
**Zhang et al., 2018.**  
**A histopathological image dataset for endometrial disease diagnosis.**
